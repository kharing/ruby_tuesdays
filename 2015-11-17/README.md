# RubyTuesdays attendees pair app

## Exercise

Write a web app that allows to input all the names of the current RubyTuesdays sessionâ€™s attendees. When the user submits the names the web app will randomly calculate and output a list of pair programming partners.

This web app could help us to switch pair programming partners in each session.

## Bonus Exercise

Handle the case where an odd number of participants was entered. For example, one group could have three members.

If you are unhappy with a match add a button to re-compute them without entering the participants again.
